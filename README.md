This package provides a comfortable way to calculate conservative nuclide vectors in accordance with the german Radiation Protection Ordinance.

## Main Features
- Store samples in a SQLite database
- automatic decay correction
- various optimization methods (measure: high Co60 and Cs137, weightable mean: lowest square deviation from the sample mean or optimize to a specific clearance path)
- various clearance path
- various clearance methods
- constraints and optional weights for radionuclides

It's written for the EWN Entsorgungswerk f√ºr Nuklearanlagen GmbH (former Energiewerke Nord GmbH).

### THIS IS NOT A MODULE!
To run the application run `src/NuclideVector.jl`

### Attention
Temporaly is coin-or.org down, so no Cbc package. I Will fix this in `REQUIRE` and `core.jl` immediately coin-or.org is up again.
